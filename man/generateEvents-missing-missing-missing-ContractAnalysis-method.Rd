\S4method{generateEvents}{missing,missing,missing,ContractAnalysis}(cntan)

Log summarizing which contracts were successfully simulated
}
\description{
The generateEvents(ContractAnalysis) function takes as input a S4
  ContractAnalysis object with the following attributes set: (1) the 
  portfolio of contracts held by the enterprise (2) the actusServerURL
  and (3) the scenario / riskFactor list to be used. The function sends a 
  simulation request to the designated ACTUS server with the contract and 
  risk data and saves the results of the simulation in the ContractAnalysis
  The method return a log message with a report on which contracts were 
  successfully simulated
